# AFTER
Automatic Filtering, Trimming, and Error Removing for fastq data   
AFTER can simply go through all fastq files in a folder and then output a <b>good</b> folder and a <b>bad</b> folder, which contains good reads and bad reads of each fastq file   
Currently it supports [Illumina 1.8 or newer format](http://support.illumina.com/help/SequencingAnalysisWorkflow/Content/Vault/Informatics/Sequencing_Analysis/CASAVA/swSEQ_mCA_FASTQFiles.htm)   

# Latest release
0.1.0 (Released in 2015-12-10)

# Feedback/contact

# Features:
AFTER does following tasks automatically:  
1, Filter PolyA/PolyT/PolyC/PolyG reads  
2, Trim reads at front and tail according to bad per base sequence content  
3, Detect and eliminate bubble artifact caused by sequencer due to fluid dynamics issue  
4, Filter low-quality reads   
5, Barcode sequencing support: if all reads have a random barcode (see duplex sequencing), this program can detect and split the barcode into query name   
6, For pair-end sequencing data, AFTER automatically corrects some low quality wrong bases in read1 and read2's overlapped area.

# Dependency:
AFTER uses `editdistance` module, run following before using AFTER:
```shell
pip install editdistance
```
If you cannot install `editdistance` module, AFTER will use a python implementation of editdistance, but it will be extremely slow.  

# Simple usage:
* Prepare your fastq files in a folder
* For single-end sequencing, the filenames in the folder should be `*_R1_*`
* For pair-end sequencing, the filenames in the folder should be `*_R1_*` and `*_R2_*`
```shell
cd /path/to/fastq/folder
python path/to/AFTER/after.py
```
* two folders will be automatically generated, a folder 'good' stores the good reads and a folder 'bad' stores the bad reads
* AFTER will print some statistical information after it is done, such how many good reads, how many bad reads, and how many reads are corrected.

                        file name of read1, required. If input_dir is
                        specified, then this arg is ignored.
  -2 READ2_FILE, --read2_file=READ2_FILE
                        file name of read2, if paired. If input_dir is

                        are input_dir are not specified, then current dir (.)
                        is specified to input_dir
  -g GOOD_OUTPUT_FOLDER, --good_output_folder=GOOD_OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        the folder to store good reads, by default it is the

  -b BAD_OUTPUT_FOLDER, --bad_output_folder=BAD_OUTPUT_FOLDER
                        the folder to store bad reads, by default it is same

  --read1_flag=READ1_FLAG
                        specify the name flag of read1, default is _R1_, which
                        means a file with name *_R1_* is read1 file
  --read2_flag=READ2_FLAG
                        specify the name flag of read2, default is _R2_, which

```
***Filter options***
```
  -f TRIM_FRONT, --trim_front=TRIM_FRONT
                        number of bases to be trimmed in the head of read. -1
                        means auto detect
  -t TRIM_TAIL, --trim_tail=TRIM_TAIL
                        number of bases to be trimmed in the tail of read. -1
                        means auto detect
  --trim_pair_same=TRIM_PAIR_SAME
                        use same trimming configuration for read1 and read2 to
                        keep their sequence length identical, default is true
                        lots of dedup algorithms require this feature
  -q QUALIFIED_QUALITY_PHRED, --qualified_quality_phred=QUALIFIED_QUALITY_PHRED
                        the quality value that a base is qualifyed. Default 20
                        means base quality >=Q20 is qualified.
  -u UNQUALIFIED_BASE_LIMIT, --unqualified_base_limit=UNQUALIFIED_BASE_LIMIT
                        if exists more than unqualified_base_limit bases that
                        quality is lower than qualified quality, then this
                        read/pair is bad. Default 0 means do not filter reads
                        by low quality base count
  -p POLY_SIZE_LIMIT, --poly_size_limit=POLY_SIZE_LIMIT
                        if exists one polyX(polyG means GGGGGGGGG...), and its
                        length is >= poly_size_limit, then this read/pair is
                        bad. Default is 40
  -a ALLOW_MISMATCH_IN_POLY, --allow_mismatch_in_poly=ALLOW_MISMATCH_IN_POLY

                        poly_X. Default 5 means disallow any mismatches
  -n N_BASE_LIMIT, --n_base_limit=N_BASE_LIMIT
                        if exists more than maxn bases have N, then this
                        read/pair is bad. Default is 5
  -s SEQ_LEN_REQ, --seq_len_req=SEQ_LEN_REQ
                        if the trimmed read is shorter than seq_len_req, then
                        this read/pair is bad. Default is 35
```
***Debubble options***   
If you want to eliminate bubble artifact, turn debubble option on (this is slow, usually you don't need to do this): 
```
  --debubble=DEBUBBLE   specify whether apply debubble algorithm to remove the
                        reads in the bubbles. Default is off
  --debubble_dir=DEBUBBLE_DIR
                        specify the folder to store output of debubble
                        algorithm, default is debubble
  --draw=DRAW           specify whether draw the pictures or not, when use
                        debubble or QC. Default is on
```
***Barcoded sequencing options***
```
  --barcode=BARCODE     specify whether deal with barcode sequencing files, default is on
  --barcode_length=BARCODE_LENGTH
                        specify the designed length of barcode
  --barcode_flag=BARCODE_FLAG
                        specify the name flag of a barcoded file, default is
                        barcode, which means a file with name *barcode* is a
                        barcoded file
  --barcode=BARCODE     specify whether deal with barcode sequencing files,
                        default is on, which means all files with barcode_flag
                        in filename will be treated as barcode sequencing
                        files
```
